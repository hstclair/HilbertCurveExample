Hilbert Curve Example
=====================

This project demonstrates a simple two way mapping between a distance value and a set of coordinates on an N-dimensional Hilbert curve.

This code is meant to accompany the material presented in the blog post entitled [**A Twisted Path**](https://halstclair.com/2020/03/01/a-twisted-path/) on [halstclair.com](halstclair.com).  It is written strictly for demonstration purposes and should not be taken as a recommended implementation (it is likely to have an unnecessarily poor performance profile).
